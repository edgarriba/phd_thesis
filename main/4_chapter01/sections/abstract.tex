The accuracy of semantic segmentation approaches is highly dependent on the training set being used and drops drastically when the statistic distribution of the test image does not match the expected distribution of the training set, a situation that will irremediably occur, as for instance, when the illumination changes from daytime to dusk. This issue is of critical importance in the context of GAVs. To address this problem we propose a fast unsupervised image transformation approach following a global color transfer strategy. Our proposal generalizes classical one-to-one color transfer schemes to the more suitable one-to-many scheme. In addition, our approach can naturally deal with the temporal consistency of video streams to perform a coherent transformation. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal in two publicly available datasets using different state-of-the-art semantic labelling frameworks.
