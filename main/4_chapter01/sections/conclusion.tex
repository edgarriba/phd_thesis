\section{Conclusions}

In this chapter we have presented an unsupervised image transformation approach to improve outdoor semantic labelling in urban scenarios, addressing the problem of images coming from different color distributions. Our approach follows a global color transfer strategy based on a novel one-to-many matching process, which also considers temporal information present in video streams. We have demonstrated that incorporating the algorithm as a preprocessing step improves the performance of several state-of-the-art semantic labelling frameworks in publicly available challenging datasets.
