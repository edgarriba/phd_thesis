\section{Motivation}

talk about the two step process for feature detection and description

\section{Feature detection}

give state of the art for detection

\subsection{Proposed Approach}
explain key.net~\citep{barroso2019keynet}

\section{Feature description}

give state of the art for features description

\subsection{Proposed Approach}
explain tfeat~\citep{balntas2016bmvc}

\section{Experiments and Results}
show results from both papers
\subsection{Results on feature detection}
keynet results
\subsection{Results on feature description}
tfeat results

\section{Discussion}
