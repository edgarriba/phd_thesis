\section{Motivation}

In the context of features detection is important to take into account all the components of the pipeline...

\section{Related Work}

introduce the feature matching pipeline example with differentiable sift and describe all differentiable components in kornia.features

\section{Proposed Approach}

describe the problem for the feature matching pipeline example with differentiable sift, etc.

\section{Discussion}

conclusions about using differentiable sift.
