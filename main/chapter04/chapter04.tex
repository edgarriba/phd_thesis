\chapter{View Synthesis of Depth Maps}
\label{chap:chap_05}
\vspace{-8mm}

\section{Motivation}

explain the work done at IRI to generate synthetic views given input depth maps, learn 4D volume features and produce new view given a rigid transformation and why is needed by the robotics community.

\section{Proposed Approach}

Describe the network and the geometry implied at 3d features level


\section{Experiments and Results}

\subsection{Dataset}

Explain about the contributed synthetic dataset for deformable objects grasping.

\subsection{Methods and evaluations}

describe the experiments obtained using the synthetic and real images.

\section{Discussion}

describe whatever conclusions we write in the to be submitted ICRA paper.\cite{eriba2020icra}
